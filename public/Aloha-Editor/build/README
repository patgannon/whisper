Important Note about building aloha:
.) New Aloha core/plugin javascript files need to be added to the file 'aloha-includes.txt'
.) New Dependency javascript files need to be added to the file 'deps-includes.txt'
.) New CSS Files need to be added to the file 'css-includes.txt'

After one of the above files is modified, run the Ant target 'build-dev-include' to recreate the file '/WebContent/core/include.js'
